Build SSG
1. Build RG for support edges
	output: sceneName.sg
2. Build SSG for scene list // SSG uses support relation in RG
	output: sceneName.ssg
	
Build Relation models
1. Compute BB AlignMat for computing Relative postions  // only need to compute once
	output: sceneName.alignMat
2. Extract Relative Positions for computing Relative and Pairwise relations  // will use support relation in RG
	output: sceneName.relPos
3. Build Relative, Pairwise, Group Relation Models and the corresoding similar model list  // need to re-compute if any new scene is added to the DB
	output: *.model and *.sim
4. Extract Support Probability for determining the probability of being support parent or child // need to re-compute if any new scene is added to the DB
	output: SupportRelation.model and SuppParent.prob
