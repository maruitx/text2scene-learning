Build SSG
1. Build RG for support edges
	// will load the mesh, but only need to compute once
	output: sceneName.sg
2. Build SSG for scene list 
	// SSG uses support relation in RG
	output: sceneName.ssg
	
Build Relation models
1. Compute BB AlignMat for computing Relative postions  
	// will load the mesh, but only need to compute once
	output: sceneName.alignMat
2. Extract Relative Positions for computing Relative and Pairwise relations  
	// will use support relation in RG;
	// need to re-compute when 
	// 1)SSG updates 
	// 2) when BB AlignMat updates
	output: sceneName.relPos
3. Build Relative, Pairwise, Group Relation Models and the corresoding similar model list  
	// need to re-compute when
	// 1) relative position updates; 
	// 2)if any new scene is added to the DB
	output: *.model and *.sim
4. Extract Support Probability for determining the probability of being support parent or child 
	// need to re-compute when
	// 1) relative position updates;
	// 2)if any new scene is added to the DB
	output: SupportRelation.model and SuppParent.prob
